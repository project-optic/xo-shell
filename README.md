# react-redux-shell


React + Redux - JWT Authentication
This app is meant to be used a shell for our POC.

# Run the App:
Download or clone. Run yarn install or npm install. Then run yarn start or npm start. 

# Structure
Features are folders = App, Homepage, Loginpage
Non-Features are also folders = _helpers, _constants _actions. They should generally be re-usuable.


# Fake Mock
Does what it says on the tin. NODE app with actual JWT token due soon.
